# what configurations do I want?

- a basic box that I can do basic things with
- a box onto which I can provision an ssh server using the config
  I wrote for the general-use repository. Which means:
  - 
- a machine that I can use for web browsing
  - possible to allocate vtty to machine so that I can just treat it
    like a normal X server?
